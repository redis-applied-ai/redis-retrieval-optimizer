# Running a study

You can run 2 types of studies:

- **Grid**: tries all options specified good for studies where the number of configurations you're testing is small or you want to be exact.
- **Bayesian optimization**: selects the next best configuration to try based on a heuristic. This is good when it would take a very long time to test all possible configurations.
