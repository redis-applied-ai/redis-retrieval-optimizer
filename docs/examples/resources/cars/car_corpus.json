The driver may wear it comfortably, and it will lock during a collision.\n\nHowever, the front passenger's seat and all rear lap/shoulder belt retractors operate in two modes: emergency locking mode, and for child-restraint systems, automatic locking mode. While we recommend you put all children in the rear seats, if you must use the front passenger seat for a child, slide the front passenger seat as far back as possible and make sure any child-restraint system is secured properly.\n\n2-14\n\nForm No.8Y64-EA-08A\n\nMazda3_8Y64-EA-08A_Edition1 Page29 Tuesday, November 27 2007 9:0 AM\n\nBlack plate (29,1)\n\nEssential Safety Equipment Seat Belt Systems\n\nWARNING\n\nAlways wear your seat belt and make sure all occupants are properly restrained:\n\nNot wearing a seat belt is extremely dangerous. During a collision, occupants not wearing seat belts could hit someone or things inside the vehicle or even be thrown out of the vehicle. They could be seriously injured or even killed. In the same collision, occupants wearing seat belts would be much safer.\n\nDo not wear twisted seat belts:\n\nTwisted seat belts are dangerous.

Its advanced design provides improved operation and requires minimum additional maintenance. To get maximum performance from your turbocharged engine, take note of the following tips: l The turbocharged engine is designed for optimal operation with premium unleaded\n\ngasoline (page 4-2). Do not use fuel with a lower octane rating. Extra fuel additives are NOT recommended.\n\nl Change the engine oil and filter using the turbo engine interval outlined in the\n\nmaintenance schedule (for your driving condition).\n\nl Use only the recommended engine oil (page 8-18). Extra oil additives are NOT\n\nrecommended.\n\nl After driving at freeway speeds or up a long hill, idle the engine at least 30 seconds to cool the turbo before turning off the engine. Avoid simply shutting the engine off abruptly after a hard or long drive. Damage to the turbocharger may result.\n\nl Don't race or over-rev the engine when starting. This should not be done with ANY\n\nengine, especially not with one that's turbocharged.\n\nl Do not add any aftermarket devices to alter the engine's ignition timing, fuel delivery, or\n\nturbo boost pressure. This may lead to serious engine damage and may void your warranty.",

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under- inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability. Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under- inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.\n\n\u00d8 Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to",

When pressure is adjusted on hot tires to the cold inflation pressure, the TPMS warning light/beep may turn on after the tires cool and pressure drops below specification. Also, an illuminated TPMS warning light, resulting from the tire air pressure dropping due to cold ambient temperature, may go out if the ambient temperature rises.

If the TPMS warning light illuminates due to a drop in tire air pressure, make sure to check and adjust the tire air pressures.\n\nl After adjusting the tire air pressures, it may require some time for the TPMS warning light to go out. If the TPMS warning light remains illuminated, drive the vehicle at a speed of at least 25 km/h (16 mph) for 10 minutes, and then verify that it goes out. l Tires can loose a little air quite naturally over time and the TPMS cannot tell if the tires are getting too soft over time or you have a flat. However, when you find one low tire in a set of four - that is an indication of trouble; you should have someone drive the vehicle slowly forward so you can inspect any low tire for cuts and any metal sticking through tread or sidewall. Put a few drops of water in the valve stem to see if it bubbles indicating a bad valve.

The tread life may be shorter depending on driving conditions.\n\n\u00d8 The temporary spare tire is for\n\nlimited use, however, if the tread wear solid-band indicator appears, replace the tire with the same type of temporary spare (page 8-36).\n\n8-37\n\nMazda3_8Y64-EA-08A_Edition1 Page324 Tuesday, November 27 2007 9:2 AM\n\nMaintenance and Care Owner Maintenance\n\nNOTE Tires degrade over time, even when they are not being used on the road. It is recommended that tires generally be replaced when they are 6 years or older. Heat caused by hot climates or frequent high loading conditions can accelerate the aging process. You should replace the spare tire when you replace the other road tires due to the aging of the spare tire. Regarding the manufacturing week and year is indicated with 4 digit. Refer to The tire labeling on page 9-23.\n\nqReplacing a Wheel WARNING\n\nAlways use wheels of the correct size on your vehicle:\n\nUsing a wrong-sized wheel is dangerous.

These acids can settle on a vehicle's finish. As the water evaporates, the acid becomes concentrated and can damage the finish. And the longer the acid remains on the surface, the greater the chance is for damage.\n\nPrevention It is necessary to wash and wax your vehicle to preserve its finish according to the instructions in this section. These steps should be taken immediately after you suspect that acid rain has settled on your vehicle's finish.\n\n8-58\n\nForm No.8Y64-EA-08A\n\nBlack plate (344,1)\n\nqDamage Caused by Bird",

        "text": "Dropping, Insects, or Tree Sap\n\nOccurrence\n\nBird droppings contain acids. If these aren't removed they can eat away the clear and color base coat of the vehicle's paintwork.\n\nWhen insects stick to the paint surface and decompose, corrosive compounds form. These can erode the clear and color base coat of the vehicle's paintwork if they are not removed.\n\nTree sap will harden and adhere permanently to the paint finish. If you scratch the sap off while it is hard, some vehicle paint could come off with it.\n\nPrevention It is necessary to have your Mazda washed and waxed to preserve its finish according to the instructions in this section. This should be done as soon as possible.\n\nBird droppings can be removed with a soft sponge and water. If you are traveling and these are not available, a moistened tissue may also take care of the problem. The cleaned area should be waxed according to the instructions in this section. Insects and tree sap are best removed with a soft sponge and water or a commercially available chemical cleaner.\n\nAnother method is to cover the affected area with dampened newspaper for one to two hours. After removing the newspaper, rinse off the loosened debris with water.\n\nMazda3_8Y64-EA-08A_Edition1 Page345 Tuesday, November 27 2007 9:2 AM\n\nqWater Marks\n\nOccurrence\n\nRain, fog, dew, and even tap water can contain harmful minerals such as salt and lime. If moisture containing these minerals settles on the vehicle and evaporates, the minerals will concentrate and harden to form white rings. The rings can damage your vehicle's finish.\n\nPrevention\n\nIt is necessary to wash and wax your vehicle to preserve its finish according to the instructions in this section. These steps should be taken immediately after you find water marks on your vehicle's finish.\n\nqPaint Chipping\n\nOccurrence Paint chipping occurs when gravel thrown in the air by another vehicle's tires hits your vehicle.\n\nHow to avoid paint chipping Keeping a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead reduces the chances of having your paint chipped by flying gravel.\n\nForm No.8Y64-EA-08A\n\nBlack plate (345,1)\n\nMaintenance and Care Appearance Care\n\nNOTE l The paint chipping zone varies with the speed of the vehicle. For example, when traveling at 90 km/h (56 mph), the paint chipping zone is 50 m (164 ft).\n\nl In low temperatures a vehicle's finish\n\nhardens. This increases the chance of paint chipping.\n\nl Chipped paint can lead to rust forming on",

Under-inflation is the most common cause of failures in any kind of tire and may result in severe cracking, tread separation or \u201cblowout\u201d, with unexpected loss of vehicle control and increased risk of injury. Under-inflation increases sidewall flexing and rolling resistance, resulting in heat buildup and internal damage to the tire. It results in unnecessary tire stress, irregular wear, loss of control and accidents. A tire can lose up to half of its air pressure and not appear to be flat!

Firmly press a tire gauge onto the valve.\n\n4. Add air to achieve recommended air pressure.\n\n5. If you overfill the tire, release air by pushing on the metal stem in the center of the valve. Then recheck the pressure with your tire gauge.\n\n6. Replace the valve cap.\n\n7. Repeat with each tire, including the spare.\n\nNOTE Some spare tires require higher inflation pressure.\n\n8.

(Important: The towing vehicle's braking system is rated for operation at GVWR, not at GCWR. Separate functional brakes should be used for safe control of towed vehicles and for trailers weighing more than 1,500 lbs). The GCW must never exceed the GCWR.\n\nMaximum Loaded Trailer Weight is the highest possible weight of a fully loaded trailer the vehicle can tow. It assumes a vehicle with only mandatory options, no cargo (internal or external), a tongue load of 10_15% (conventional trailer) or king pin weight of 15_25% (fifth-wheel trailer), and driver only (150 lbs). Consult your dealership (or the RV and Trailer Towing Guide provided by your dealership) for more detailed information. Tongue Load or Fifth-Wheel King Pin Weight refers to the amount of the weight that a trailer pushes down on a trailer hitch.\n\nExamples: For a 5000 lb conventional trailer, multiply 5000 by 0.10 and 0.15 to obtain a proper tongue load range of 500 to 750 lbs. For an 11,500 lb fifth-wheel trailer, multiply by 0.15 and 0.25 to obtain a proper king pin load range of 1,725 to 2,875 lbs.\n\n9-40\n\nForm No.8Y64-EA-08A\n\nMazda3_8Y64-EA-08A_Edition1 Page391 Tuesday, November 27 2007 9:2 AM\n\nBlack plate (391,1)\n\nCustomer Information and Reporting Safety Defects Tire Information (U.S.A.)\n\nWARNING\n\nExceeding GVWR or GAWR Specifications:",

For example, if the \u201cXXX\u201d amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400_ 750 (5 \u00d7 150) = 650 lbs.)\n\n(5) Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the\n\nvehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.\n\n(6) If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, the load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle.

Some of the computers can record infor-mation during normal driving if they detect anerror. In addition, information is recorded in theevent of a crash or incident. Parts of the recor-ded information are required so that techni-cians can diagnose and rectify faults in thevehicle during servicing and maintenance andso that Volvo can fulfil legal requirements andother regulations. In addition to this, the infor-mation is used for research purposes by Volvoin order to continually develop quality andsafety, as the information can contribute to abetter understanding of the factors that causeaccidents and injuries. The informationincludes details of the status and functionalityof various systems and modules in the vehiclewith regard to engine, throttle, steering andbrake systems, amongst other things. Thisinformation may include details regarding theway the driver drives the vehicle, such as vehi-cle speed, brake and accelerator pedal use,steering wheel movement and whether or notthe driver and passengers have used theirseatbelts. For the reasons given this informa-tion may be stored in the vehicle's computersfor a certain length of time, but also as a resultof a collision or incident. This information maybe stored by Volvo as long as it can help tofurther develop and further enhance safety andquality and as long as there are legal require-ments and other regulations that Volvo needsto consider.Volvo will not contribute to the above-descri-bed information being disclosed to third partieswithout the vehicle owner's consent. However,due to national legislation and regulationsVolvo may be required to disclose such infor-mation to authorities such as police authorities,or others who may assert a legal right to haveaccess to it.To be able to read and interpret the informationrecorded by the computers in the vehiclerequires special technical equipment thatVolvo, and workshops that have entered intoagreements with Volvo, have access to.

Volvo Car Corpo-ration has global ISO certification, whichincludes the environmental standard ISO14001 covering all factories and several of ourother units. We also set requirements for ourpartners so that they work systematically withenvironmental issues.Fuel consumptionVolvo cars have competitive fuel consumptionin each of their respective classes. Lower fuelconsumption generally results in lower emis-sion of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.It is possible for the driver to influence fuel con-sumption. For more information read under theheading, Reducing environmental impact.Efficient emission controlYour Volvo is manufactured following the con-cept \"Clean inside and out\" \u2013 a concept thatencompasses a clean interior environment aswell as highly efficient emission control. Inmany cases the exhaust emissions are wellbelow the applicable standards.Clean air in the passenger compartmentA passenger compartment filter prevents dustand pollen from entering the passenger com-partment via the air intake.A sophisticated air quality system, IAQS* (Inte-rior Air Quality System) ensures that the incom-ing air is cleaner than the air in the traffic out-side.The system consists of an electronic sensorand a carbon filter.

In this way you contribute to acleaner environment. When Volvo's workshopsare entrusted with the service and mainte-nance of your car it becomes part of our sys-tem. We make clear demands regarding theway in which our workshops are designed inorder to prevent spills and discharges into theenvironment. Our workshop staff have theknowledge and the tools required to guaranteegood environmental care.Reducing environmental impactYou can easily help reduce environmentalimpact - here are a few tips:\u2022Avoid letting the engine idle - switch off theengine when stationary for longer periods.Pay attention to local regulations.\u2022Drive economically - think ahead.\u2022Perform service and maintenance inaccordance with the owner's manual'sinstructions - follow the Service and War-ranty Booklet's recommended intervals.\u2022If the car is equipped with an engine blockheater*, use it before starting from cold - itimproves starting capacity and reduceswear in cold weather and the engine rea-ches normal operating temperature morequickly, which lowers consumption andreduces emissions.\u2022High speed increases consumption con-siderably due to increased wind resistance- a doubling of speed increases wind resis-tance 4 times.\u2022Always dispose of environmentally hazar-dous waste, such as batteries and oils, inan environmentally safe manner. Consult aworkshop in the event of uncertainty abouthow this type of waste should be discarded- an authorised Volvo workshop is recom-mended.Following this advice can save money, theplanet's resources are saved, and the car'sdurability is extended. For more informationand further advice, see the pages 142 and295.RecyclingAs a part of Volvo's environmental work, it isimportant that the car is recycled in an envi-ronmentally sound manner.

This refrigerant contains no chlo-rine, which means that it is harmless to theozone layer. The system must only be chargedwith R134a refrigerant, see also page 292.Volvo recommends that an authorised Volvoworkshop carries out this work.Passenger compartment filterAll air entering the car's passenger compart-ment is only cleaned with one filter. This mustbe replaced at regular intervals. Follow theVolvo Service Programme for the recom-mended replacement intervals. If the car isused in a severely contaminated environment,it may be necessary to replace the filter moreoften.\n\nThere are different types of passenger com-partment filter. Make sure that the correctfilter is fitted.\n\nAir conditioningThe climate control system cools or heats aswell as dehumidifies the air in the passengercompartment. The car is equipped with eithermanual (AC) or electronic climate control (ECC,Electronic Climate Control).\n\nNOTE\n\n03\n\nThe air conditioning system can beswitched off, but to ensure the best possibleair in the passenger compartment and pre-vent the windows from misting, it shouldalways be on.",

It is not possible to open a doorif the remote control key is on the other side ofthe car.The grey area in the illustration indicates therange covered by the system's antennas.If someone leaves the car and takes a keylessdrive remote control key with them, a warningmessage appears on the information displayand a reminder signal sounds. The warningmessage disappears when the remote controlkey is brought back to the car or when the igni-tion dial is turned to position 0. The warning isonly issued if the ignition dial is in position I orII after someone has opened and closed adoor.The warning message and reminder signal dis-appear when the remote control key is broughtback to the car after one of the followingactions:\u2022a door has been opened and closed\u2022the ignition dial has been turned to position0\u2022the READ button has been pressed.Never leave any remote control key in thecarIf a remote control key with keyless drive func-tion is left in the car, it is made passive whenthe car is locked. This prevents unauthorisedentry.If someone breaks into the car and finds theremote control key, it can be activated andused again. It is therefore important to handleall remote control keys with equal care.Interference to remote control keyfunctionElectromagnetic screening and fields can inter-fere with the keyless drive system. To avoidthis: do not place the remote control key nearmobile phones, metallic objects or, for exam-ple, in a metal briefcase.If interference is experienced nonetheless, usethe remote control key and key blade in thenormal way, see page 126.\n\nG007577\n\n05 Locks and alarmKeyless drive*\n\n130\n\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine",

Only use diesel fuel fromwell-known producers. Never use diesel ofdubious quality.At low temperatures (-40 \u00b0C to -6 \u00b0C), a paraffinprecipitate may form in the diesel fuel, whichmay lead to ignition problems. Special dieselfuel designed for low temperatures aroundfreezing point is available from the major oilcompanies. This fuel is less viscous at low tem-peratures and reduces the risk of paraffin pre-cipitate.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nUse special winter grade fuel during coldmonths.\n\n06\n\nDiesel particle filter (DPF)Diesel cars may be equipped with a particle fil-ter, which results in more efficient emissioncontrol. The particles in the exhaust gases arecollected in the filter during normal driving. So-\n\nEmpty tankThe design of the fuel system in a diesel enginemeans that if the vehicle runs out of fuel, thetank may need to be vented in the workshop inorder to restart the engine after fuelling.Once the engine has stopped due to fuel star-vation, the fuel system needs a few momentsto carry out a check. Do this before starting theengine, once the fuel tank has been filled withdiesel:1.Insert the remote control key in the ignitionswitch and turn to key position II (seepage 152).2.Wait approx. 1 minute.3.To start the engine: Depress the brake and/or clutch pedal, and turn the remote controlkey to start position III.Draining condensation from the fuel filterThe fuel filter separates condensation from thefuel. Condensation can disrupt engine opera-tion.The fuel filter must be drained at the intervalsspecified in the Service and Warranty Bookletor if you suspect that the car has been filledwith contaminated fuel.\n\nDiesel type fuels which must not be used:special additives, Marine Diesel Fuel, fueloil, RME1 (Rape Methyl Ester) and vegetableoil. These fuels do not fulfil the requirementsin accordance with Volvo recommendationsand generate increased wear and enginedamage that is not covered by the Volvowarranty.\n\nThe risk of condensation in the fuel tank isreduced if the tank is kept well filled. Whenrefuelling, check that the area around the fuelfiller pipe is clean. Avoid spilling fuel onto thepaintwork. Wash off any spillage with deter-gent and water.\n\nOnly ever use fuel that fulfils the Europeandiesel standard.\n\nIMPORTANT",

Theexperience is that the engine has been runningthe whole time but with an extremely quiet andlow idling speed.The Start/Stop function gives the driver theopportunity for a more active environmentallyconscious driving style by means of being ableto disengage gear and letting the engine auto-stop, whenever appropriate.Smart chargingThe car's kinetic energy is used during enginebraking by means of it being converted intoelectricity and stored in the car's battery.Adapted power steeringAnother DRIVe function is that the power steer-ing's energy take-off is adapted according torequirements. By means of optimisation andthe introduction of an energy saving functionthe energy take-off can be minimised on occa-sions where power assistance (help in turningthe steering wheel) is not necessary.AerodynamicsThe DRIVe concept also includes a loweredchassis, front and rear spoilers with low windresistance, as well as specially developedwheel rims1.",

This precaution is alsorecommended before parking the car for a longperiod in such weather conditions.If the brakes are used heavilyWhen driving in the Alps or other roads withsimilar characteristics, the car's brakes areheavily loaded even if the brake pedal is notbeing depressed especially hard.Because speed is often low, the brakes are notcooled as effectively as when driving on flatroads at higher speed.So as not to overload the brakes, shift downwhen driving downhill instead of using the footbrake. Use the same gear driving downhill asyou would use driving uphill. This uses enginebraking more efficiently so the foot brake isonly required for brief periods.Bear in mind that driving with a trailer puts anadditional load on the car's brakes.Anti-lock braking system - ABSThe anti-lock braking system(ABS) prevents the wheels fromlocking up during braking.This means the ability to steer ismaintained and it is easier to swerve to avoid ahazard for example.\n\nBrake system\n\nIf braking with the engine switched off,press the brake pedal sharply once, notrepeatedly.\n\n06\n\n06 Starting and driving\n\n167Brake servoIf the car is rolling or is being towed with theengine turned off, the brake pedal must bedepressed about 5 times harder than when theengine is running.

        "text": "195The reason for this is that tyres age and decom-pose, even if they are hardly ever or never used.The function can therefore be affected due tothe tyre's constituent materials being brokendown. In such a case the tyre should then notbe used. This also applies to spare tyres, wintertyres and tyres saved for future use. Examplesof external signs which indicate that the tyre isunsuitable for use are cracks or discoloration.The age of the tyre can be determined by theDOT marking, see previous illustration.More even wear and maintenanceThe correct tyre pressure results in more evenwear, see page 198. Driving style, tyre pres-sure, climate and road condition affect howquickly your tyres age and wear. To avoid dif-ferences in tread depth and to prevent wearpatterns arising, the front and rear wheels canbe switched with each other. A suitable dis-tance for the first change is approx. 5000 kmand then at 10 000 km intervals. Volvo recom-mends that you contact an authorised Volvoworkshop for checking if you are uncertainabout tread depth. If significant differences inwear (>1 mm difference in tread depth)between tyres have already occurred, the leastworn tyres must always be placed on the rear.Understeer is normally easier to correct thanoversteer, and leads to the car continuing for-wards in a straight line rather than having therear end skidding to one side, resulting in pos-sible complete loss of control over the car.

The choice of oilhas been made very carefully with regard toservice life, starting characteristics, fuelconsumption and environmental impact.An approved engine oil must be used inorder that the recommended service inter-vals can be applied. Only use a prescribedgrade of oil for both filling and oil change,otherwise you will risk affecting service life,starting characteristics, fuel consumptionand environmental impact.Volvo Car Corporation disclaims all war-ranty liability if engine oil of the prescribedgrade and viscosity is not used.Volvo recommends that oil changes are car-ried out at a workshop - an authorised Volvoworkshop is recommended.\n\n11\n\nAdverse driving conditionsAdverse driving conditions can lead to abnor-mally high oil temperature or oil consumption.Below are some examples of adverse drivingconditions.Check the oil level more frequently for longjourneys:\u2022towing a caravan or trailer\u2022in mountainous regions\u2022at high speeds\u2022in temperatures colder than -30 \u00b0C or hot-ter than +40 \u00b0CThe above also apply to shorter driving dis-tances at low temperatures.Choose a fully synthetic engine oil for adversedriving conditions.

The regulations cover the driving cycles for city driving and driving on main roads. - City driving - The measurement starts with cold startingthe engine. The driving is simulated. Driving on main roads - the car is accelerated and braked at speeds between 0-120 km/h. The driving is simulated. - Cars with the D2 engine and 6-speedmanual transmission with Start/Stop are started in 2nd gear. - The value for combined driving, which is reported in the table, is a combination of city driving and driving on main roads, in accordancewith legal requirements. CO2 emissions - the exhaust gases are collected in order to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions during the two driving cycles. These are then analysed and give the valuefor CO2 emissions.\n\n11 SpecificationsFuel\n\n183\n\n11\n\nAE85\n\n5.8\n\n134\n\n106\n\n154",

This, as well as how heavily the caris loaded, increases fuel consumption and car-bon dioxide emissions.There are several reasons for increased fuelconsumption compared with the table's val-ues. Examples of this are:\u2022The driver's driving style.\u2022If the customer has specified wheels largerthan those fitted as standard on the mod-el's basic version, then resistance increa-ses.\u2022High speed results in increased wind resis-tance.\u2022Fuel quality, road and traffic conditions,weather and the condition of the car.Even a combination of the above-mentionedexamples can result in significantly improvedconsumption.
